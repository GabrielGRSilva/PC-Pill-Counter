# PC-Pill-Counter
A Python app to track medications and pills!

It features options for users to track medications they are using and how many pills they have left, enabling them to easily remove a pill when they take it in real life and add more when they purchase new ones.


Features:
    [t] Take pill -- Removes one pill from the total amount and marks the medicine as taken for today;

    [c] Check how many pills are left -- Allows you to see how many pills you have left from the currently tracked medicine;

    [r] Refill medicine inventory with more pills -- Adds more pills to your total (for example, when you have bought more);

    [a] Add or remove medicine from your list -- Adds or remove a new medicine from the app data.

The app uses a JSON file to store data for each medicine the user has chosen to track.

Planned features:

-Turn Pill Counter into an Android app with complete UI.

-Add reminder when the pill counter for a certain medicine becomes too low.

-Enable users to create a daily reminder for when they should take a certain medicine.
